The way the author describes the characters, the scenery, and the story kept me intrigued for the duration. She does a really good job at keeping you reading, and I don't have any doubts that other historical fiction fans would enjoy this book. I also enjoyed the points in the story where US politics and Irish upbringings merged. It was definitely intriguing.Reviewed by IABookReviews.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n","|5      |A very good book showing the sorrow and then the joy of foster care providers.

That pain is adding stress to the pressure of the darkness that is never far from his mind lately. Leave it to their boss (for lack of a better term) Will to send him back to Elle and Michael to wait for another task that the three Grimm must handle.Seeing Elle is like salt in a grievous wound, and even her kindness causes pain. As an empath, he knows she feels his pain. As Elle, he knows she'll try to ease it. What surprises him, almost unmans him, is that Michael is surprisingly amenable. And the truth, the one that neither Ren nor Elle can escape, is that both still bear wounds not yet healed, and each needs the other for the love of their friendship and the hope of some peace.For those unfamiliar with Shiloh Walker's Grimm's Circle series, this is not the place to start to become familiar. This short story is more of a coda on the end of the second book in the series,No Prince Charming, and should in no way be considered a self-contained short story. There almost no explanation of the events in the book preceding it, and little exposition on the world in which it occurs. For those who haven't read that second book, this short story could seem little more than a salacious bit of gratuitous erotica.In truth, though, it's closure for two people who desperately needed it, and though the focus is on Ren, whose story is up next in the series (yay!), the events are just as important to Elle. Her death was such that it scarred her in ways that aren't important to list here, but with this little tale, those scars were tenderly addressed.I'm not entirely convinced it was necessary to be handled in this format, though, and I was disappointed that the sole focus was on the sexual scene. The \"\"job\"\" Will sent them on was completely ignored except in passing. It did make this little piece of fiction seem a bit unnecessary and salacious                                                                                                                  |\n","|4      |What an interesting book!

For those unfamiliar with Shudderville, it's best if you start at the beginning. This episode concerns Will Ballard and his ongoing obsession with going back (you know what I'm talking about) and finding a way to make his wife, Charlotte, love him. His wish finally comes true...to disastrous results. We also find out more about Jayla, the once dead daughter of Sophie who is now determined to get her back. Meanwhile, Will tries to erase a bad memory...or three...once he discovers his future children with Charlotte are not all that pleasant to be around.Sound twisted enough for you? It should and it's good that it should. Zabrisky offers up another twisted and twisting tale focusing on the fracturing relationship Will has with everyone around him, including his one-time scientist partner Tobias, who is on a search of his own. Lots of characters, dozens of interactions, and plenty of convoluted connections that are slowly being revealed. Best way to read these stories is to binge read in order to keep every loose end in hand. Even then, the fun is finding another connection you didn't see coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n","|3      |The storyline was good and  I liked the interaction between the characters.
